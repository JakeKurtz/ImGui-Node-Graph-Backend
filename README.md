# ImGui Node-Graph Backend

This is an extension of the project [imnodes](https://github.com/Nelarius/imnodes). 
From sound processing to graphics shaders, the goal here is to provide a flexible API for building custom node-based editors for whatever purpose.

## Sample Code

They can be found in the following folders:

- /Node Graph/Basic Example
- /Node Graph/Shader Example

Basic Example, as the name suggests, is a super simple implementation using the API. The Shader example implements a shader node graph, which builds GLSL code, and displays its output.

| Basic | Shader |
